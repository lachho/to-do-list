This is a simple to do list, that can be hosted on a local server. 
DoToo contains the ability to link a todo item to a parent item, as well as add tags to do list items, and much more.
Standard CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE functions are implemented within this project. 

I have written a server, dataStore and the implementation itself using TypeScript. Please see the swagger file for details on the functions of the application.
